    "## Why do I need to know this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a way to allow us as humans to manipulate information (data) on a scale much larger than we would otherwise be able to handle. Speaking anecdotally, on a good day my brain is able to handle one mathematical operation per second. I can remember a few things at once, and a few more things if I spend a while memorizing them. On the other hand, my laptop can handle millions of mathematical operations per second, and can \"memorize\" the contents of a spreadsheet fast enough that to me it feels instantaneous. When we use Python, we are accessing the amped up computational power provided by our computers to enable us to focus on thinking critically, and letting our computer handle the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do computers handle data? At the most basic level, it all gets digested into the same form: 1s and 0s. Were we to attempt a very complete treatment of information and computation, we would need to start there. Suffice it to say that computers need all information to be concrete, and that information that cannot be quantified or written in a fixed form is no good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting with binary values (the 1s and 0s above), we have the privilege of experiencing our interactions with computers through a high-level programming language: Python. High-level is an indication that the programming language is closer to a human-readable form than a computer-readable form. While we are working furiously to do our work writing in Python, the computer is translating everything that we say (in Python) to machine-speak. High-level code is slower to run than low-level (easier for machines to translate) code, but we accept that tradeoff in order to minimize the time and effort we spend in writing our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Python code is MUCH easier than writing code in just about any other language. Trust me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Then how do I start?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to understand when we start to interact with Python is the language's ability to represent different kinds of information. The types of information that can be stored, and the ways in which we can store them, inform the choices that we will make as we begin to programmatically handle the information that is available to us. Think of each method of storing information as storage bins like you might find in a kitchen: one bin is intended to hold sugar, another flour, and another rice. Sure, you could insist on putting rice in the sugar bin, but the next chef to use the kitchen might not appreciate your choice. In programming, we should look for the appropriate storage bin for the information that we are dealing with in any specific context\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we label the different storage bins **data types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type is an **object** (we will discuss this more later) that is designed to handle a specific kind of information. Let's take a look at a few different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can work with data as if the Python interpreter (the thing that runs our code) were a fancy calculator, and we can just type all the information we need into the interpreter each time we run code. This is not feasible, however, for larger projects. In those cases, we store information in what are called **variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any data type can be stored as a variable. The names we give these variables are nearly infinite. There are a few rules and guidelines (rules will be bolded) on how we should name them, though:\n",
    "- **Names cannot start with numbers**\n",
    "- Names should be lower case\n",
    "- **Names can include letters, numbers, and underscores**\n",
    "- Names should be descriptive\n",
    "- Names should not be reserved words\n",
    "\n",
    "We store information as a variable in the following way:"

    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are the data type in Python that is used to store text data, or data that does not fit into other categories and can be best represented as text in some form. This might be text values proxying for job types, it might be sentences written in a document, or it might be a single character, like \"e\". Strings are immensely valuable for creating dense data, and have many built-in features (we call them **methods**) to improve our ability to handle strings. First, we create a string by putting some characters inside of quotation marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Quotation Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "The quotation marks indicating the start and end of strings can be \\\" or \\'. It is worth choosing carefully, however, because the quotation marks we use to denote a string limit the characters that we can place inside. If I use \\\", then double quotes cannot be used within my string (while single quotes can!). Conversely, using \\' to start and end a string means that we cannot use single quotes (often used to mark apostrophes within contractions in the English language) inside of our string."

    "\n",
    "Within a list, we can use **slicing** to find specific elements or to reference a specific position within a list. First, let's make a list to play with by **storing** a list. We can **store** a list (or any other object) in memory by assigning it a name using the \\= symbol. After we have given an object a name, we can refer to that object by its name whenever we want to make use of the object. There are some simple rules for naming things in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable names must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only. \n",
    "- Periods CANNOT be part of variable names (helpful advice for any recovering R users out there...)\n",
    "- Variable names typically begin with lower case letters, and CANNOT begin with numbers.\n",
    "- If you want to use multiple words in a variable name, separate the words with underscores (\\_) or by capitalizing all but the first word (called **camel casing**)\n",
    "- While you can use any word you want for a variable's name, you should avoid [reserve words](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22864221/is-the-list-of-python-reserved-words-and-builtins-available-in-a-library) wherever possible."
